# Stack

Stack is a layout component that makes it easy to stack elements together and apply a space between them.

[`ðŸ’¬ Feedback`](https://github.com/yamankatby/react-native-flex-layout/labels/stack) , [`ðŸŒ± Source`](https://github.com/yamankatby/react-native-flex-layout/blob/main/src/Stack.tsx)

## Import

```js
import { Stack, HStack, VStack } from 'react-native-flex-layout';
```

- **Stack:** Used to add spacing and/or dividers between items in the horizontal or vertical direction.
- **HStack:** Shorthand for `<Stack direction="row" />`.
- **VStack:** Shorthand for `<Stack direction="column" />`.

## Usage

To stack elements in horizontal or vertical direction only, use the `HStack` or `VStack` components. You can also use
the `Stack` component as well and pass the `direction` prop.

```jsx
<Stack spacing={16}>
  <Box w={64} h={64} />
  <Box w={64} h={64} />
  <Box w={64} h={64} />
</Stack>
```

### Adding dividers

In some scenarios, you may want to add dividers between stacked elements. Pass the divider prop and set its value
to `true` or any custom React element.

```jsx
<VStack spacing={16} divider={true}>
  <Box w={64} h={64} />
  <Box w={64} h={64} />
  <Box w={64} h={64} />
</VStack>
```

### Stack items horizontally

Pass the `direction` and set it to `row`. Optionally, you can use `align` and `justify` to adjust the alignment and
distribution of the items.

### Notes on Stack vs Flex

Stack's primary use case is to lay items out and control the spacing between each item. If you have a more complicated
use case, such as changing the margin on the last child, you can combine `Stack` and `Flex` and
use `justify-content: space-between` for more control of the layout.

| `divider`            | `React.ReactElement`         | If `true`, each stack item will show a divider.                                                    |
| `dividerStyle`       | `StyleProp<ViewStyle>`       | A style object to apply to each divider.                                                           |
