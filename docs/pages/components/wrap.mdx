# Wrap

Wrap is a layout component that adds a defined space between its children. It wraps its children automatically if there
isn't enough space to fit anymore in the same row.

Think of it as a smarter `flex-wrap` with `spacing` support. It works really well with things like dialog buttons, tags,
and chips.

## Import

```js
import { Wrap } from 'react-native-flex-layout';
```

## Usage

In the example below, you see that the last `Box` wrapped to the next line.

### Change the spacing

Pass the `spacing` prop to apply consistent spacing between each child, even if it wraps.

### Change the alignment

Pass the `align` prop to change the alignment of the child along the cross axis.

Pass the `justify` prop to change the alignment of the child along the main axis.

## Props API

<PropsTable
  props={[
    {
      name: 'spacing',

      type: 'Spacing',
      default: '0'
    },
    {
      name: 'shouldWrapChildren',
      description: 'If `true`, the children will be wrapped in a `Box` and the `Box` will take the spacing properties',
      type: 'boolean',
      default: 'false'
    }
